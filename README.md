I've defined several functions for you and I need to you write out their bodies and return statements and then call them so they actually get displayed on index.html.

* Find all the TODO comments in functions.js. Replace them with your code.
* Find all the TODO comments in index.html and replace them with your function calls (see question 1 for an example)
* Bonus points: Change the styling or html to add a personal touch to the page.
